## Data Flow

### Contact Form Flow
1. User fills out contact form with validation
2. Frontend submits data via POST /api/contact
3. Backend validates using Zod schema
4. Data stored in PostgreSQL contacts table
5. Success/error feedback displayed to user


## üßÆ Carbon Calculator

The carbon footprint calculator evaluates four key areas:

### Transportation
- Monthly driving miles
- Fuel type (Gasoline, Diesel, Electric, Hybrid)
- Emission factors based on fuel type

### Energy Usage
- Monthly electricity bill
- Monthly gas bill
- Conversion to CO‚ÇÇ emissions

### Food & Diet
- Diet type (Omnivore, Vegetarian, Vegan, Pescatarian)
- Local food consumption percentage
- Diet-specific emission factors

### Lifestyle
- Annual flights
- Household size
- Additional lifestyle factors

## üéØ Personalized Recommendations

Based on calculated emissions, the app provides targeted suggestions:

- **Transportation**: Public transit, carpooling, electric vehicles
- **Energy**: LED bulbs, renewable energy sources
- **Food**: Reduced meat consumption, local produce
- **Lifestyle**: Flight offsetting, sustainable travel choices

##üìã Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Navigation**: Use the top navigation to jump between sections
2. **Theme Toggle**: Click the theme button to switch between light/dark modes

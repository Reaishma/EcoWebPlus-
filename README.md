## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and build processes
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth user interactions

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Connection**: Neon Database serverless driver
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management
- **Session Storage**: In-memory storage with fallback to PostgreSQL sessions

### Key Design Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared schema and types between client and server
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage across the entire application

2. Frontend calculates emissions using predefined factors
3. Results displayed with personalized recommendations
4. Progress tracking capabilities for future iterations

### Theme Management
1. Theme preference stored in localStorage
2. CSS variables updated dynamically
3. Theme context provides global state management
